The Image to PDF Converter project is a web application that allows users to convert images into PDF files. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can select an image file, and the application simulates the conversion process. A loading section provides feedback during the conversion. Once the conversion is complete, a download link is provided for users to obtain the converted PDF file. The project incorporates animated elements and a visually appealing design. Note that this is a simplified version, and actual image-to-PDF conversion would require server-side processing.
